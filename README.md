# Profanity-Filter
Greasemonkey script for basic filtering for profanity from website text.

This is designed for performance, not features. It is just a personal project to make it easier to ignore the stupidity of the internet.

Only supports American English

To install, first install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey) or similar userscript addon, then add this script to it. Supported browsers (those it is specifically tested on) are Pale Moon, Firefox, Chromium, and Opera.
